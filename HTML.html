                <h5 style="margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:10px">Councillor hails progress on new Torry School and Community Hub</h5>
                <img class="articleImg" src="img/article-img.jpg">
                <p>
                    Aberdeen’s new Convener of the Council’s Capital Programme Committee today (Thursday 14 July)
                    visited
                    the
                    site of the forthcoming Torry School and Community Hub to see progress on the new development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Convener Councillor Christian Allard saw at first-hand the structure taking shape following the
                    commencement
                    of construction work last month at the site of the former Torry Academy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The building is scheduled for completion by autumn 2023 and will be home to a new primary school
                    including
                    an Early Learning and Childcare (ELC) centre as well as a Community Hub.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Councillor Allard said: “I was delighted to come along to see progress on a site which will become a
                    real
                    focus of the Torry community; providing first-class facilities for young and old alike including a
                    434
                    capacity school and a provision for 100 ELC pupils who will be able to enjoy outdoor playing
                    facilities
                    on-site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “With a community café, a library, rehearsal, performance and recording facilities, multi-purpose
                    rooms
                    including office space for services and a 3G seven-a-side pitch, there will be something for
                    everyone in
                    a
                    Hub that the entire Torry community can be proud of.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The input of the community into the project via the locality Tory Partnership has been crucial in
                    making
                    the site a reality and I greatly look forward to seeing the school and hub open to the people of
                    Torry
                    next
                    year.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peter Ramsay, operations director for hub North Scotland, who are the council’s development partner
                    in
                    the
                    project, said: “Our Torry project has got off to a good strong start and we are looking forward to
                    working
                    with both Aberdeen City Council and Morrison Construction to deliver an asset that will be enjoyed
                    by
                    the
                    whole community for generations to come.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mike Bruce, Managing Director of Morrison Construction Building North East, said: “We are excited to
                    be
                    delivering this high-quality new school for the community that will create an inspirational learning
                    environment for local children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “With our project at Countesswells also progressing well it reinforces our established approach of
                    working
                    with our local supply chain partners and our own tradesmen and apprentices ensuring our exacting
                    quality
                    standards are met on site.“
